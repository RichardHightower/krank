#summary Building Crank

To get the build to work you have to checkout the whole stack of stuff... 


{{{
svn co http://krank.googlecode.com/svn/trunk crank 
cd crank 
mvn install 
}}}

And that will build the whole stack, including the crank-crud-webapp-sample. 


After its built everything you can then use the jetty plugin to get 
the app running. 

{{{
cd crank-crud-webapp-sample 
mvn jetty:run 
}}}

then you can go to; 


http://localhost:8080 


and see the app running (you have to click on the url that it pops up 
at the url). 


Hope this helps. 


TTFN,
