#summary How to Join Multiple Entities using Crank's FilteringPaginator support

==== Introduction ====

Crank and Presto before it has always had the ability to create paginateable, sortable listings for several years now. Lately we ran into two issues as follows:

 # Unable to sort, filter on fields in a sublcass
 # Unable to sort, filter on fields that don't have a relationship to entity

We did a major update to the `FilteringPaginator` and the Criteria DSL to support selecting and filtering multiple entities in a single listing.
