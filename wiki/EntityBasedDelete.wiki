Entity based delete strategy.


= Details =

A new feature has been added to the Crank Crud Controller to allow for the deletion of the full entity.  Before this feature, Crank Crud invoked the GenericDao delete method the removes database rows by executing a query that deletes the row with the entity’s id.  If the entity id has collections of related entities, a referential integrity error would usually result.  This new feature allows GenericDao’s delete method that performs a remove on the entity to be invoked.  When the entity has collections of other entities that implement the remove option in their cascade strategy, the entities in the collections will also be deleted.

The new feature is implemented by setting a value for the ‘DeleteStrategy” property of the crud controller that manages the entity to be deleted.  By default, the value id set to “BY_ID” so existing controllers will continue to function as they always have.  

To set a controller to delete full entities –

# Override the controller’s delete strategy in its configuration –
# Be sure to use the controller for the listing as well as the crud form –
# Be sure that remove cascade strategy is included for the collections to be deleted with the entity -
