#summary Updating Listing Controller to Allow Entity Joins

=== Problem ===

Let's say we have classes as follows:

{{{
//inquiries
class Inquiry
class PetStoreInquiry extends Inquiry has property a
class PetClinicInquiry extends Inquiry has property b

//leads
class Lead has an Inquiry (one to one)
class PetStoreLead extends Lead
class PetClinicLead extends Lead
}}}

The question is while searching for `PetStoreLead`s how do you access properties of the inquiry subclass?

This query drives JPA(Hibernate) wild and causes an error:

{{{
select lead from PetStoreLead lead where lead.inquiry.a
}}}

The error you get is that `lead.inquiry` does not have a property called `a`.
