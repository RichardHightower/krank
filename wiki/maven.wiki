#summary Short how-to describing building out a release of Krank.  This document is primarily for project developers.

*Preconditions:*
    # You must have run a mvn install before attempting the release.
    # You may also want to run `mvn scm:validate` and `mvn scm:changelog` to make sure your subversion connection is happy or else the release attempt may fail.  
    If you get _ERROR svn: Can't connect to host 'krank.googlecode.com': A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond._
    then you need to run `svn log -v https://krank.googlecode.com/svn/` manually, and accept the server certificate (p for permanently).  You should not need to repeat this step.  Rerun `mvn scm:changelog` and it should work out this time.

See:
http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-release-plugin/examples/prepare-release.html

First, check the version of the root POM file.  Make a mental note...

Execute:
`mvn release:prepare`

Carefully answer the prompts, you will be asked for 
#A release version number
#A release tag
#A new development version number

If anything goes wrong, the safest thing is usually to start over.  This requires
`mvn release:prepare -Dresume=false` (or `mvn release:clean release:prepare`).  You may also need to revert the POM's that were modified by the release:prepare goal.  

This will:
#Create versioned release jars
#Create a tag in scm.
#Update scm with re-versioned POMs.
