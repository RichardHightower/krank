#summary Crank Crud Design Documentation

= Introduction =

Covers the basic structure of Crank Crud. At least the `CrudContoller` parts.

== CRUD Controller Design Details ==

The `CrudController` class is the controller for forms that edit entities (domain objects like Department, Employee, etc.). `DetailCrudController` class is the controller for editing details. Think of `DetailCrudController` as the "detail" in Master detail. `CrudController` has a map of `DetailController`s. For example a `CrudContoller` might be tied to a `Department` entity class. The `Department` form may allow editing of `employees` on the `Department` form. Thus the `Department` `CrudController` would have an employees (map key = `employees`) `DetailController` associated with it. `CrudControllerBase` is the code that is used by both `CrudController` and `DetailController`.

The `CrudController` class implements the `CrudOperation`s interface. The `CrudOperation`s interface defines a composition pattern structure.

None of the above is tied to Spring MVC or JSF. You can use the above with any GUI frontend espcially with those that use expression binding languages like JSF EL and OGNL.
