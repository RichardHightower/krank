#summary Crank Crud Design Documentation

= Introduction =

Covers the basic structure of Crank Crud. At least the `CrudContoller` parts.

== CRUD Controller Design Details ==

The `CrudController` class is the controller for forms that edit entities (domain objects like Department, Employee, etc.). `DetailCrudController` class is the controller for editing details. Think of `DetailCrudController` as the "detail" in Master detail. `CrudController` has a map of `DetailController`s. For example a `CrudContoller` might be tied to a `Department` entity class. The `Department` form may allow editing of `employees` on the `Department` form. Thus the `Department` `CrudController` would have an employees (map key = `employees`) `DetailController` associated with it. `CrudControllerBase` is the code that is used by both `CrudController` and `DetailController`.

The `CrudController` class implements the `CrudOperation`s interface. The `CrudOperation`s interface defines a composition pattern structure.
