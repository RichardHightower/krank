#summary For people who are new to JSF

This is a short guide to get you moving in the Crank direction and get the most out of Crank.

= Details =

First, thanks for looking into Crank. I think you will be pleasantly surprised.


The idea is to come up to speed with Crank.

Think of a simple object model and then map it to Crank. Make it up. This is a prototype. We plan on throwing it away. 


Before you get started (proposed steps) you will want a little background on the Crank project. If you are using the JSF Crud development model, you need to understand JSF, Facelets, Crank and Ajax4JSF.

To get an understanding of JSF read these four articles:

Step 1: Clearing up the JSF FUD 
[http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-jsf1/ Intro to JSF]
[http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-jsf2/ JSF Lifecycle]
[http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-jsf3/ Conversion and Validation]
[http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-jsf4/ Intro to creating components]

Then to come up to speed on Facelets read this:

Step 2: Facelets: 
http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-facelets/ 
http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/j-facelets2.html

The last two article are very important because they discuss the design principles that back Crank (they are written wrt Presto). (Crank improves on them quite a bit.)

Once you have the above under your belt please read about Crank itself

Step 3 Crank:

http://code.google.com/p/krank/wiki/CrankCrudIntro Introduction (should make a lot of sense based on Facelets articles)
http://code.google.com/p/krank/wiki/CrankCrudDesignDocs Design of Crank Crud 


Step 4: Manage some objects
Then once you read the above, try to map a Form domain object, and Field domain objects to a CRUD listings.

You can download the code from svn at https://krank.googlecode.com/svn/code/trunk/validation/. (Don't use the binary snapshot)

You need maven 2 to build any of our apps.

Base you example on the sandbox http://krank.googlecode.com/svn/code/trunk/validation/crank-crud-webapp-sample/

Step 5: Try to use tab panel and tree from rich faces (or tomakawk, or ice faces... start with richfaces since it builds on Ajax4JSF)

https://ajax4jsf.dev.java.net/

http://livedemo.exadel.com/richfaces-demo/

Try managing the Forms as a node, with fields as child nodes. When you pick a form node it allows you to configure form properties (and the other stuff that is in the panel).

Don't worry about the real object model. Simplify it as much as you need to and get familar with the technique.
