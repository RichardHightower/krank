  ** Annotation and Property file is supported
  * JSF Integration via JSF Validation integrtation
  * Spring MVC/Spring Webflow Integration via Spring Validator
  * Can Generate JavaScript based on Validation metadata
  * Can make Ajax calls based on Validation metadata
  * Easy to integrate with existing annotation driven frameworks

= Working Features Of CRUD Framework =
 * JPA DAO object
 * You can define finder methods using no Java code (AOP enabled)
 * A lightweight Detached Criteria API that uses POJOs
 * An easy to use Detached Criteria DSL (domain specific language) that makes using the Criteria API a breeze.

 * 1.0.x releases support JSF 1.x framework, and spring IOC.
 * 2.0.x release is currently planned and will support JSF 2.x along with latest versions of JPA and spring IOC. Plans for improving support with Richfaces 4.x and Primefaces.
