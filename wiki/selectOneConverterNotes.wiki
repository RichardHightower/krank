#summary SelectOne Converter Notes

= Introduction =

Just some notes on how we worked around issues with JSF 1.2.


= Details =

Both Presto and Crank use a class called SpringApplication, which is a Spring enabled, JSF application class implementation.

This class is used to load converters and such that allow DI via Spring. The problem with this class is that in JSF 1.2, it uses the EL mechanism to load the converters and it by passes converters loaded with the Application object and somehow gets them right from faces-config, which of course is a bug that has not been fixed as of release 1.2.04. I created an incredible hack for Crank to get around this problem, that I hope I don't have to recreate for Presto 2.
