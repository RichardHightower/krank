#summary detailListing problems with Ajax4JSF and Facelets Composition components

Facelets has composition components which are very similar to working with Facelets templates. You can for example pass a composition component ui:defines tag in its body as well at attributes. In the composition component you use named ui:inserts to pull the ui:defines into various parts of the body. The docs for this are a bit sketchy, but I did write a prototype and it worked.

However when using named ui:inserts/ui:defines with Ajax4JSF the named ui:inserts don't seem to work. Tom has documented more about this here and here (TBD).

For example here is how we would like to use detailListing composition component:

{{{
<crank:detailListing detailController="${taskDetailController}"

                    propertyNames="name,startDate,endDate,complete">

	<ui:define name="formBody">

            <h:outputText value="Hello World!" />

        </ui:define>

	<ui:define name="columActions">

 	    <a4j:commandLink action="#{hello.sayHello}" value="hello" >
											  
                  <f:param name="id" value="${row.id}" />
										  
            </a4j:commandLink>

        </ui:define>
		
</crank:detailListing>

}}}
